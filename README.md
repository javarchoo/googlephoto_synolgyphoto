# googlephoto_synolgyphoto

This project provides tools and scripts to assist in migrating media files from **Google Photos** to **Synology Photos**, with a focus on preserving and updating essential metadata such as:

- 📍 Location (GPS coordinates)
- 🕒 Timestamps (date taken, modified)
- 📁 Year/Month folder organization
- 📄 Metadata synchronization using ExifTool

The goal is to maintain photo integrity during migration and make the media fully compatible with Synology's indexing and timeline features.
